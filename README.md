Due to time constraints, business agreements and intellectual property protection, the implementation of this model is partial. If you are interested in our model, please contact me by email.
This repo model is a simplified model and is allowed for commercial use, but please cite. If you want to use the complete implementation model, you can further negotiate business cooperation, thank you very much for your attention.
